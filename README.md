# A--Pathfinding-Algorithm
This project visualizes the A* pathfinding algorithm using Pygame. It allows users to interact with a grid to set start and end points, place obstacles, and see the algorithm in action as it finds the shortest path between the start and end points.


**Features**__
Interactive Grid: Click to set start, end, and obstacle cells.
A Algorithm*: Visualizes the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path.
Color-Coded Cells: Different colors represent start, end, obstacles, visited cells, and the final path.
Reset and Clear: Right-click to reset individual cells, and press 'C' to clear the grid.


**Requirements**__
Python 3.x
Pygame library
