# A--Pathfinding-Algorithm
This project implements the A* pathfinding algorithm using Pygame. It allows users to interact with a grid, set start and end points, place obstacles, and visualize the algorithm finding the shortest path. The user can click to set points and obstacles, and press space to run the algorithm.
